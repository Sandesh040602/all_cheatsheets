 47 # always rememeber to take diff as some can delete your diffs
 48 # thats why creating the diff is very important

 50 [m is used to jump at the start at the starting of the function
 51 # as a genious i am i also discovered that ]m is used to reach the end of the function we are currently present
 52 # we can also do one thing write [m to reach the start of the function, the use % to reach the other end of the bracket
